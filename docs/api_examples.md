curl -X GET "https://crashed-backend-production.up.railway.app/api/analytics/series/without-min-crash-point/10" -H "X-Timezone: America/New_York" | jq .
```

## Using the X-Timezone Header

All endpoints support the `X-Timezone` header for converting datetime values to a specific timezone:

```bash
# Example with timezone
curl -X GET "https://crashed-backend-production.up.railway.app/api/analytics/series/without-min-crash-point/10" \
  -H "X-Timezone: America/New_York" | jq .
```

Common timezone values:

- `UTC`: Coordinated Universal Time
- `America/New_York`: Eastern Time
- `America/Chicago`: Central Time
- `America/Denver`: Mountain Time
- `America/Los_Angeles`: Pacific Time
- `Europe/London`: British Time
- `Europe/Paris`: Central European Time
- `Asia/Tokyo`: Japan Time
- `Asia/Shanghai`: China Time
- `Australia/Sydney`: Australia Eastern Time
